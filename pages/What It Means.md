<p>I recently visited the Attack on Titan (AOT) Museum in Japan and it got
me thinking about the story again after learning more about the author's
thoughts in the process of creating this story. <strong>*Spoilers ahead*</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>The history of the titans' origin begins around 2,000 years ago, Ymir
was enslaved by the Eldians and transformed into the first Titan after
merging with a mysterious creature. She used her Titan powers to serve
the Eldians by cultivating land and defeating their enemies, eventually
bearing three children who became the ancestors of the nine Titan Shifters.
The Subjects of Ymir, her descendants, are the only ones capable of becoming
Titans, connected through invisible "Paths" that converge at the Founding
Titan, also known as the coordinate. Here's a summary of the 9 Titan Shifters:
